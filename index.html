					<p> 
						 Vienna, Austria. <br>
						 Clubbing with my girlfriends.<br>
						 A lady sitting by herself. <br>
						 I feel sorry for her. No one should be in a dance club all alone.<br>
						 I tell my friends: <i> I'm going to chat with her and ask her to come sit with us.</i> <br>
						 I go and say Hi. <br>
						 I introduced myself. <br>
						 I ask her to come join us.
						 She says: <i> Go away, leave me alone! </i> ðŸ˜³ <br>
						 I say to my friends: <i> She must feel really lonely. Some people say they want to be alone but they don't really want that.</i> <br>
						 I am not willing to give up. <br>
						 So I insist. <br>
						 Several times.<br>
						 <b> I never give up on people.</b> ðŸ™„<br>
						 She keeps telling me to go away.<br>
						 She is more and more annoyed with me.<br>
						 After many... many attempts, I give up.<br>
						 We later find that she is a sex-worker and me being around her is interfering with her business.<br>
